# PP HW 5 Report 
#### 113062574 葛奕宣

## 1. Overview
> In conjunction with the UCP architecture mentioned in the lecture, please read [ucp_hello_world.c](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/examples/ucp_hello_world.c)
1. Identify how UCP Objects (`ucp_context`, `ucp_worker`, `ucp_ep`) interact through the API, including at least the following functions:
    - `ucp_init`
Initializes the UCP context. It takes in 3 parameters, a user defined parameter for configuring context, a config for configuring the library, and a pointer that retrieve the created context. Inside the function, it will init everything context need, including allocating memory, filling config, generating uuid, rcache, vfs......etc.
    - `ucp_worker_create`
        Create the ucp_worker, responsible for managing resources and enabling data transfers, return the created worker in the provided *worker parameter. We provided the context we created and parameters for configuring the worker.
        The function begins by allocating memory for the worker and initializing its fields, such as UUID, counters, and thread-safety mode, based on user-provided parameters. Then, it setup communication resources, including transport interfaces (UCT workers), memory pools, tag matching for message passing, and active messages (AM) for custom protocols.
    - `ucp_ep_create`
        This function create and connect the specific EP we want, EP is the representation of connection. This functnion resides in *[run_ucx_client()](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/examples/ucp_hello_world.c#L224)* and *[run_ucx_server()](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/examples/ucp_hello_world.c#L378)*,  this make sense because this two function is responsible for the communication between server and client, thus EP(connection) is created inside them. Because ep resides in worker, so we need to provide a specific worker in the parameter, just like we provide context to worker creation. 
        Inside this function, we first use UCP_PARAM_VALUE to decide the flags. Then, 3 kinds of ucp ep create is selected, including sock_addr, api_conn, worker_addr. These 3 establish different endpoints. 
2. UCX abstracts communication into three layers as below. Please provide a diagram illustrating the architectural design of UCX.
* The ucx architecure is like below figure. A context would have 1~many worker and a worker would have 1~many eps.

> Please provide detailed example information in the diagram corresponding to the execution of the command `srun -N 2 ./send_recv.out` or `mpiucx --host HostA:1,HostB:1 ./send_recv.out`

* For this case, there are 2 process communicate with each other. The diagram is like below.

3. Based on the description in HW5, where do you think the following information is loaded/created?
    - `UCX_TLS`
    This may loaded from parsing config from user at the begining when creating context. 
    - TLS selected by UCX
    Based on the discription, TLS is related to transport layer. I think it will be loaded/created during the worker creation function because this worker manage each ep. 

## 2. Implementation

> Describe how you implemented the two special features of HW4.
1. Which files did you modify, and where did you choose to print Line 1 and Line 2?
* [*ucp_worker_print_used_tls( src/ucp/core
/ucp_worker.c)*](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/src/ucp/core/ucp_worker.c#L1764)
    * I print the two lines here. The first line I called *ucp_config_print(NULL,stdout,NULL,UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS)*, the second line I use *fprintf* to print the result of *strb* transformed to str.
```cpp
ucp_config_print(NULL,stdout,NULL,UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS);
fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", ucs_string_buffer_cstr(&strb));
```
* *[ucs_config_parser_print_opts( src/ucs/config
/parser.c)](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/src/ucs/config/parser.c#L1853)*
    * I add a if for the message flag. Inside the if, I iterate through all the env using environ and find the desired UCX_TLS using strncmp.
```cpp
if (flags & UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS) {
    char **envp;
    for (envp = environ; *envp != NULL; ++envp) {
        if(!strncmp(*envp, "UCX_TLS", 7)) {
            fprintf(stream, "%s\n", *envp);
        }
    }
}
```
    
* *[types.h( src/ucs/config
/types.h)](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/ce5c5ee4b70a88ce7c15d2fe8acff2131a44aa4a/src/ucs/config/types.h#L88)*
    * add a type for printing the desired content.
```cpp=
typedef enum {
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_CONFIG          = UCS_BIT(0),
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_HEADER          = UCS_BIT(1),
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_DOC             = UCS_BIT(2),
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_HIDDEN          = UCS_BIT(3),
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_COMMENT_DEFAULT = UCS_BIT(4),
    UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS            = UCS_BIT(5)   //add
} ucs_config_print_flags_t;
```


2. How do the functions in these files call each other? Why is it designed this way?
* The reason why we need to call ucp_config_print to print the UCX_TLS is that env data resides in parser.c and also it's where most printing function locates. 
3. Observe when Line 1 and 2 are printed during the call of which UCP API?
* trace the function stack, the 2 lines are printed in ***ucp_ep_create()***
4. Does it match your expectations for questions **1-3**? Why?
* No, the information are loaded/created in ep creation. I think it is becasuse TLS is selected in runtime, so we cannot choose TLS first when creating worker. Instead, when ep is created, it will select its own TLS during the process.
5. In implementing the features, we see variables like lanes, tl_rsc, tl_name, tl_device, bitmap, iface, etc., used to store different Layer's protocol information. Please explain what information each of them stores.
* lanes
    * lane is a communication pathway associated with a specific transport resource. It's possible to have multiple lanes inside a ep. In [ucp_ep.h](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/blob/b44cd453d50b455d01c8ded2f8b703bd55c7aae0/src/ucp/core/ucp_ep.h#L218), we can see the the detail information about lanes in the below figure. Also, in `ucp_proto_common`, we can see functions about lanes. `ucp_proto_common_lane_priv_t` is used to store per lane private data. 

* tl_rsc
    * it is in type *uct_tl_resource_desc_t*, it stores transport name, device name/type......etc. In general, it represent virtaul or actual communication resource like network interface, communication port......etc.
* tl_name
    * inside tl_rsc, means transport name.
* tl_device
    * it is in type *[uct_tl_device_resource_t](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/blob/b44cd453d50b455d01c8ded2f8b703bd55c7aae0/src/uct/base/uct_iface.h#L377-L386)*, it **represent the transport device**, containing type, name, system device.
* bitmap
    * tl_bitmap stores the used tl resource. It can be used for discovering network interface(iface) or other resource. 
* iface
    * it is in type *[iface_info_t](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/blob/b44cd453d50b455d01c8ded2f8b703bd55c7aae0/src/uct/api/tl.h#L295-L375)*, it is the communication interface that stores informations like memory domain, allocated worker......etc.
```c=
typedef struct {
    uct_iface_attr_t    iface_attr; /* Interface attributes: capabilities and limitations */
    uct_iface_h         iface;      /* Communication interface context */
    uct_md_attr_t       md_attr;    /* Memory domain attributes: capabilities and limitations */
    uct_md_h            md;         /* Memory domain */
    uct_worker_h        worker;     /* Workers represent allocated resources in a communication thread */
} iface_info_t;
```

## 3. Optimize System 
1. Below are the current configurations for OpenMPI and UCX in the system. Based on your learning, what methods can you use to optimize single-node performance by setting UCX environment variables?

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/opt/modulefiles/openmpi/ucx-pp:

module-whatis   {OpenMPI 4.1.6}
conflict        mpi
module          load ucx/1.15.0
prepend-path    PATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/bin
prepend-path    LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/lib
prepend-path    MANPATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/share/man
prepend-path    CPATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/include
setenv          UCX_TLS ud_verbs
setenv          UCX_NET_DEVICES ibp3s0:1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
```

> Please use the following commands to test different data sizes for latency and bandwidth, to verify your ideas:
```bash
module load openmpi/ucx-pp
mpiucx -n 2 $HOME/UCX-lsalab/test/mpi/osu/pt2pt/osu_latency
mpiucx -n 2 $HOME/UCX-lsalab/test/mpi/osu/pt2pt/osu_bw
```
I use `ucx_info -d` to get the information of the device and transport layer we can use and do the experiment about latency and bw on all combination.
The possible devices are enp4s0f0(tcp), ibp3s0(tcp), ibp3s0:1(ib), lo(tcp)
* Combinations:
    * Note: I failed to use rc_verbs though ucx_info shows it. I later find out that rc_verbs needs to use with tcp.
```bash=
    "TL=ud_verbs NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0:1"
    # "TL=rc_verbs NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0:1"
    "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=enp4s0f0"
    "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=lo"
    "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0"
    "TL=sysv"
    "TL=posix"
    "TL=cma"
```
* I run the experiement on apolloc-cpu server
#### Lantency
![iamge](https://i.imgur.com/WT03GX0.png)
* Comparison:
    * posix and sysv maintain the lowest latency, especially for smaller data sizes, showing efficiency for high-frequency small transactions. This may because the shared memory approach , which introduce lowest network overhead.
    * ud_verbs/ibp3s0:1 offers moderate latency, better than TCP protocols for most data sizes since RDMA bypass kernel.
    * TCP protocols exhibit the highest latency, especially for larger data sizes, with tcp/enp4s0f0 performing worse than others.
#### Bandwidth
![image](https://i.imgur.com/o5cf0tK.png)
* Comparison:
    * posix and sysv show the highest bandwidth performance, especially for larger data sizes. This is obvious because they use shared memory approach.
    * ud_verbs/ibp3s0:1 also performs well, outperforming TCP-based protocols (tcp/enp4s0f0, tcp/ibp3s0, and tcp/lo) consistently.
    * TCP protocols exhibit similar trends but lag behind in peak bandwidth.
#### Summary:
* For high-performance tasks requiring high bandwidth and low latency, posix and sysv are ideal.
* For large data transfers, ud_verbs/ibp3s0:1 is a competitive alternative.
* TCP-based protocols, while versatile, lag in both bandwidth and latency.
* To my surprise, IB has close performance to tcps.
### Advanced Challenge: Multi-Node Testing

This challenge involves testing the performance across multiple nodes. You can accomplish this by utilizing the sbatch script provided below. The task includes creating tables and providing explanations based on your findings. Notably, Writing a comprehensive report on this exercise can earn you up to 5 additional points.
#### extra experiment

The main difference between single-node and multi-node lies in network device and transport layer limitations. In multi-node, we can only use br0(tcp), ibp3s0(tcp), ibp3s0:1(ib), lo(tcp). Plus, sysv, posix, cma is disabled since it's intra-node. 
For the following experiment, I will test each combinations performance on `osu_latency`.
* Combinations:
    * Note: I failed to use lo as net device, it shows lo/tcp cannot reach destination. I am not sure if the hardware is connected between them.
```bash=
    "TL=ud_verbs NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0:1"
    "TL=rc_verbs NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0:1"
    "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=br0"
    # "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=lo"
    "TL=tcp NET_DEVICE=ibp3s0"
```
![e](https://i.imgur.com/ePnfaXp.png)
* Note: br0 runs too slow and reach time out so the result only shows part of them.
* We observe that two RDMA over IB (InfiniBand) configurations consistently outperform TCP, both in single-node and multi-node scenarios. This highlights the significant advantages of RDMA in terms of hardware and software optimizations.

* When comparing RC (Reliable Connection) Verbs and UD (Unreliable Datagram) Verbs, RC Verbs exhibit slightly better performance. This outcome is somewhat unexpected, as RC Verbs typically incur additional overhead due to their connection-oriented nature. A possible explanation for this behavior could be that RC Verbs benefit from TCP assistance in this setup, whereas UD Verbs do not leverage such optimization.
